- 👋  Hello, and welcome to my github page! My name is Wilhelm Ågren, and I am currently studying at KTH Royal Institute of Technology for a masters degree in Data Science and Machine Learning. As of writing this README I only have one semester left at KTH in which I will be writing my final degree project! The plan is to explore and analyse results of Self-Supervised Learning applied to Magnetoencephalography data. If you are interested in learning more about this degree project, feel free to explore my public repository for it (DA231X-Degree-Project).

- ⭐ Apart from the degree project, I am also working on some open source projects that you may want to help and contribute to! For example, a streamlined advent-of-code solver that manages data-fetching and time-tracking of your solutions, and a chess TUI with complementary limited lookahead AI based on a deep CNN model. Other than coding related business, I have a burning passion for music and my big dream in life is to utilize deep learning techniques to create creativity and personality where one would assume there is none to be found.


- 📫  If you (yes, you, the one reading this) have any questions, want to collaborate on something, or want to discuss potential working offers; feel free to send me an email at either of these emails <wagren@kth.se, wilhelmagren98@gmail.com>

/ 🎄 Happy holidays
