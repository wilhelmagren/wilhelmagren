- ðŸ‘‹  Hello, welcome to my github page! My name is Wilhelm Ã…gren, and I am currently studying at KTH Royal Institute of Technology for a masters degree in Computer Science with a with a focus on Data Science and Machine Learning. I only have one year left and I am hoping to have an opportunity to study some niche area of Deep Learning for my masters thesis. 

- ðŸŒ±  My great interests and passions in life are music, padel, reading, coffee/fika, and spending quality time with friends or family. My big dream in life is to work with Deep Learning and music, to create creativity and personality where one would assume there is none to be found.


- ðŸ“«  If you (yes, you, the one reading this) have any questions, want to collaborate on something, or want to discuss potential working offers; feel free to send me an email at either my school related email: wagren@kth.se, or my personal email: wilhelmagren98@gmail.com


/ Wilhelm
