- üëã Hello and welcome to my github page! My name is Wilhelm √Ögren, and by the summer I will be completing my M.Sc.Eng degree at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Information Technology and Computer Science. During my master's track I focused on courses relating to data science, which yielded me great theoretical understanding and practical expertise in a vast amount of state-of-the-art deep learning paradigms. Don't believe me?, then take a look at some of my course repositories or individual projects. 
- ‚≠ê My [bachelor's thesis](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-2906&pid=diva2%3A1450578&c=4&searchType=SIMPLE&language=en&query=wilhelm+%C3%A5gren&af=%5B%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=all) was written together with Johan Edman, where we investigated the M-Bus protocol (EN 13757-x) from a legal and security perspective as per requested by Svea Smart Grid AB. My individual master's thesis was a collaborative project with Karolinska Institutet and Stockholm University where I researched and proposed feature extraction methods on MEG data by using the newly emerged self-supervised learning paradigm.
